    <h1>Squid are Dope</h1>
    <p>They're inky and adorable. Look at that and tell me it's not cute. They can be very colorful</p>
    <p>They are cephalopods of two orders, Myopsida and Oegopsida. Each squid has 8 arms arranged in pairs and 2, usually longer, tentacles. There are 304 known species of squid. That's a lot of tentacles.</p>
